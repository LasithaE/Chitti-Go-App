## Inspiration

As remote working (or work from home) has become the new mainstream during the pandemic,
would it change the way we look at the gig economy? As a definition, this includes all types of
jobs on a contractual basis or per-delivery basis. Cab drivers, delivery staff, home service
providers, and other skilled freelance professionals across IT, design, consulting, etc, make up a
major chunk of this economy.
Even though they contribute to a sizable amount in the country’s economy, the major problem
affecting gig workers revolves around their inconsistent income flow. This disheartens a great
many numbers of people in the gig community who have no full-time jobs, have weak or unstable
financial backgrounds but have the necessary skills.

## What it does

We are proposing an online credit extension system that mimics the traditional chit fund system
which helps in inculcating a savings mentality among the community members and thus
preparing them for any kind of financial emergencies coming their way.
This is where we would like to introduce ‘ChittiGo’, an online platform where we implement
above said ideas in a kind of unconventional but effective manner.
A chit fund is both a savings and credit product. Traditionally, it bears a predetermined value
and is of a fixed duration, mostly two to three years. Each scheme admits a specific number of
members whose monthly contributions add up to the total value of the chit fund at the end of the
term.
The app provides an online platform for gig workers to join a chitti of their choice according to
their monthly income but this is not where we plan to introduce a change.
Apart from traditional chit funds which work on large amounts of money for longer periods, the
ones which operate on our platform will depend on surveys that we conduct. Based on the
general trend obtained from them, we determine the chit amount and their time period. This
displays how our chit system is flexible in nature and how it caters to their immediate cash
requirements. It works on leveraging connections between gig workers having similar
occupations within the same locality.
We act as a trustee of each and every chitti ensuring the safe and timely payments of dues as
well as scrutinizing the complete transaction flow through the app


## How I built it

We plan to integrate FFDC API’s for payment and account handling functionalities. Additionally
we will use chat API’s for our connections page. Other tech stacks used include:
● Flutter(Dart)
● Firebase - realtime - database
● Adobe XD
● Adobe Photoshop

## Challenges I ran into

We worked really hard in order to shape our final idea to focus on banking the unbanked and
underbanked. We have upskilled ourselves to build our app according to our needs.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Optimal utilization of two months of this lockdown period to learn new tech stacks and also to
come up with a better solution to a gripping problem faced by our society today.

## What I learned

Tough times don't last tough teams do.
-Victoria Brown

during this journey, we learned that while working together as a team we can surmount any challenge that comes our way!

## What's next for Chitti Go

We have more ideas yet to implement such as providing further banking services to the gig
workers and pulling them more into the mainstream financial services.
